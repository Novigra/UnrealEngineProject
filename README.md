## Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot! ðŸ”« (WIP)

In this project, the player plays against an AI, and both of them enter two phases. In the first phase, the player and the AI play a rock-paper-scissors match.

Excuse my poor animations.ðŸ˜­

In the second phase you will enter a fight battle and your weapon and character attributes will depend on wether you won the RPS match or not this phase is like a second chance for the player who lost if you lose you get a high fire rate weapon but its damage is low you move fast but your health is half the maximum number and for the winner in the first phase get a slow fire rate weapon but its damage high you move slow but your health is full.

The game design is simple, but it is far from over. There are so many things to think of, like how to balance the power between two players, how to reward the first phase winner without making him overpowered, if we add abilities, what can we add, and the most important question: is the game fun to play?

Hopefully soon, when I finish the project, I will add a walkthrough and show how I implemented everything in the code and blueprint.ðŸ˜‰
